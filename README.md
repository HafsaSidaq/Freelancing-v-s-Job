# Freelancing-v-s-Job
To gather diverse perspectives from individuals on the most advantageous qualities for both freelance work and full-time employment, we designed an online survey questionnaire consisting of 14 questions, along with demographic questions about age and experience. This survey was distributed to capture a wide range of responses, resulting in a dataset of 1,120 samples. After preprocessing this dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency, we developed a comprehensible and reliable model to analyze the data. Of the 1,120 respondents, 511 identified as freelancers, while the remaining 609 were engaged in full-time jobs. This division allows for a comparative analysis between the two groups, enabling us to identify key qualities that are valued in each type of employment.
